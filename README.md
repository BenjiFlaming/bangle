# Bangle

The Bangle crate provides strongly-typed angles, specified in
radians, degrees, rotations, or percentages,
with efficient and ergonomic conversion between units.
Both 32-bit and 64-bit floating point numbers are supported,
with 32 bits being the default if no numeric type is explicitly specified.

This library also serves as a bridge between functions or data structures
which need angles specified in radians, and programmers who (like me)
sometimes find it more convenient or intuitive to specify or modify angles in other formats.
